Having several (snapshots of) video recordings - captured via a Webcam or uploaded by a user - regarding an urban route (frequently/randomly) followed by a person or a group of persons (e.g., by using a bike/car/bus), develop a (micro-)service-based Web system able to detect road/traffic signs marking this route (road, highway). This detection process could be performed automatically by using specific public APIs and/or by using user-reported info (for example, by using external crowdsourcing navigation services)
