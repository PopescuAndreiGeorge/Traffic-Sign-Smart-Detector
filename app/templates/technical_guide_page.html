<section id="internal-data-structures">
    <h2>Internal Data Structures</h2>
    <p>Internal data structures are the backbone of any application, determining how data is stored, accessed, and managed. In the Traffic Sign Smart Detector, several key data structures play a crucial role in ensuring efficient data handling and retrieval. The primary data structures include image data, sign metadata, and user data.</p>

    <h3>Image Data</h3>
    <p>The application stores raw images captured by the camera or uploaded by the user. Each image is processed and resized to a standard dimension to facilitate efficient analysis. The image data structure includes attributes such as the image file path, timestamp, and associated metadata.</p>

    <h3>Sign Metadata</h3>
    <p>This data structure contains detailed information about each recognized traffic sign. The metadata includes attributes such as the sign category (e.g., regulatory, warning, informational), meaning, legal regulations, and relationships with other signs. The sign metadata is linked to the RDF-based knowledge model, ensuring consistent and accurate representation of traffic sign information.</p>

    <h3>User Data</h3>
    <p>To enhance the user experience, the application maintains user-specific information, such as preferences and interaction history. This data structure includes attributes such as user ID, preferences (e.g., preferred language, notification settings), and interaction history (e.g., previously recognized signs, user feedback). The user data is stored securely, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.</p>

    <p>The internal data structures are designed to support seamless data exchange between different components of the application. The image data structure facilitates efficient image processing and analysis, while the sign metadata structure ensures accurate retrieval of traffic sign information. The user data structure enhances the user experience by providing personalized recommendations and notifications. Together, these data structures form the foundation of the Traffic Sign Smart Detector, enabling it to deliver accurate and efficient traffic sign recognition.</p>
